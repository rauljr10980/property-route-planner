# ✅ All Files Now Processed Server-Side

## What Changed

**Before:**
- Small files (<10MB): Processed client-side
- Large files (>10MB): Processed server-side

**Now:**
- **ALL files:** Processed server-side for fast and accurate results

## Benefits

✅ **Consistency:** All files processed the same way  
✅ **Speed:** Server processing is faster for all file sizes

## How It Works

1. **Upload:** File sent to server
2. **Processing:** Server processes in chunks (5,000 rows at a time)
3. **Progress:** Real-time updates shown in UI
4. **Results:** Processed data returned to frontend
5. **Storage:** File automatically saved to GCS

## What You'll See
